# Shadow Man Speedrunning Rules

This GitHub page serves to make the community aware of the Shadow Man speedrunning community rules. This was created in Git to show a historical record of changes to our rules, and for non-repudiation purposes.

Our community aims to make the rules as fair as possible, but new discoveries can break old rules or cause a brief period of confusion. When new skips are found we will try our best to update our rules so that the game continues to be fair to everyone in the community.

Due to there being multiple releases of the game, there are multiple sections for different versions of the game.
