# General Rules
Note: These rules apply to all categories, but some categories can supersede these rules. These cases will be pointed out explicitly.

1. No hacking/exploiting is allowed, such as modifying game files to edit speed, values, etc.
2. Using the in-game save system IS allowed because it was intentionally implemented by the devs.
3. You may run the game in either Windowed mode or Fullscreen mode, this does not affect your submission.
4. Using items, skins, abilities, etc. from other save files is NOT allowed in the speedrun. The speedrun should play exactly as it would if someone were to buy the game brand new and not have any previous save files when launching the game. This includes, but is not limited to, the instances highlighted below.
   * a) Duplicating items across saves is NOT allowed as this requires you to use values from another save-state. If you accidentally duplicate across saves but don't use the glitch to your advantage then the run will still be accepted.
   * b) Activating secrets that have been obtained in other save-states is NOT allowed. You may pick up secrets during a run and use them, but you may not use secrets from other runs. This rule explicitly exists because of the Duppie flying glitch introduced in Patch 1.4 on the PC version of the game. Activating secrets is considered a NG+ option and does not belong in the normal categories of the game.
5. You do not have to use the auto-splitter but this is not recommended because you will lose time to loads. If you do not use the auto-splitter and manually pause the timer for loads then your run will not be accepted because this is inaccurate and hard to verify.
6. Custom LiveSplit layouts are allowed and encouraged, but your splits should include an in-game timer. If you have your layout set to show Real Time instead of In-Game Time then your submission will include load times (not recommended).
7. You can not tab out of the game to execute glitches, this is out of the scope of the game engine itself.
8. On-screen FPS counters are recommended but not required due to FPS not affecting the speed of the game (it did in the original). You can enable FPS by typing `con_showfps 1` in the console. External FPS counters are allowed, but using the one provided by the game will produce the best results.
9.  You may not type commands into the developer console at any point during the run, and you must have all developer console cheats disabled.
10. Video submissions must be 480p or higher to provide sufficient proof that a run is legitimate. Desirable resolution is 720p or higher.
11. Glitches are allowed for all categories except for categories that explicitly ban them (see Glitchless). Note that this is different from a hack/exploit.

# New Game Plus Notes
1. You are allowed to activate secrets that have been obtained in other saves. These secrets are "game-wide", meaning that they are not tied to a single save. If you unlock the secret in any one of your save files, the secret will show up in the secrets menu no matter what save file you load. **This supersedes General Rule 4b**.
   * a) This includes ALL secrets and the glitches that result from them, such as Duppie Jump.
   * b) You are allowed to start runs with secrets enabled as this is an intended feature of NG+.
   * c) General Rule 4a still applies, you may not duplicate items across saves.

# Cheat% Notes
1. You ARE allowed to use the following commands: (**This supersedes General Rule 9**)
   * `stat`
   * `infiniteammo`
   * `giveinv`
   * `givevoodoo`
   * `givecadeaux`
   * `giveammo` (includes all `giveammo` commands)
   * `givegad`
2. The above commands are allowed because they make the speedrun interesting, but don't completely break the speedrun. Commands such as `god` or `jumpsector` make the speedrun way too trivial and are therefore not included in this category.
3. All commands must be entered *after* the timer starts.

---

# Patch 1.0 Special Notes
1. You may type "freecam" into the developer console before starting your run, which will disable a special door that was put into the game right before the final cutscene.
   * a) This rule is allowed based on a community vote. This door was originally made to troll speedrunners and the developer who introduced the door said they would be removing it in the next patch. Unfortunately, the next patch also introduced a bunch of new limitations, such as disabling wall jumping. Due to this annoyance, we decided to make a separate category (1.0) that allows players to experience a version of the game which doesn't have the troll final door, and which also has walljumping. Ideally there would be a version with walljumping and without the final door, but unfortunately the walljumping patch was included with the patch that removed the troll door. **This supersedes General Rule 9**.
